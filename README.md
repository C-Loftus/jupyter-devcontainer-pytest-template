# Jupyter devcontainer template with pytest

Quickly set up a reproducible notebook environment with sane testing defaults

All work you do inside the container will be synced to your host machine, while still allowing you to do all development in a completely isolated environment. 

## Start dev containers

1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Inside VSCode
    1. Open **Command Pallette** by pressing `F1` 
    2. Select `> Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

> [!TIP]
> You will need to rebuild the container if you make changes to the dockerfile or the devcontainer.json which configures it
